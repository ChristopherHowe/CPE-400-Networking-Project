## Goal
The goal of this project was to create a simple simulation environment that users can play with to get a feeling for how all the different protocols in the internet work. The scope of that is quite large, so only a few of them will be implemented.


## Things that need to be completed
* Create a function to add nodes in locations besides the origin.
* Create a function to make nodes moveable
* Create router nodes.
* Add support so nodes no longer show text when a user zooms out and become clickable.
* Add some kind of way to add packets to each node with destination/payload
